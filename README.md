# Kannada-MNIST-Classification-Using-Neural-Networks
In this project we developed three machine learning models for classification task on Kannada-MNIST dataset. Kannada is a language spoken predominantly by people of Karnataka in southwestern India. For model performance evaluation, we used MLP, CNN, and RNN.

By looking at the results, all three models showed a good performance on the Kannada-MNIST digit classification task. However, the CNN is the favored one since CNNs are almost exclusively made for image and grid-like data classification.

However, we decided to combine the results of the three models to get the most accurate predictions. This resulted in a private score of 96.74% and public score of 96.90% in KAGGLE competition
